Software maintenance can often feel like a boring/time-consuming task. You're not alone. But what if I told you there's a magical tool that could change all that? Meet [`grit`](https://www.grit.io/), new best friend in the coding world promises to turn the tedious task of software development into something you might enjoy.

Grit is like your personal software maintenance superhero, handling those tedious code migrations, dependency upgrades, and backlog tasks that you've been avoiding.

**TLDR**:  
\- Run `grit init`  
\- Use the below config if you are working with Javascript/Typescript

```yaml
version: 0.0.2
patterns:
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_console_log
    tags: ["logging"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#prefer_early_return
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_async_promise_executor
    tags: ["code-quality", "promise"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_prototype_builtins
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_throw_literal
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#replace_wildcard_imports
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#unused_imports
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
```

* Run `grit check` command to see the matching between patterns with your project.
    
* Run `grit apply PATTERN_NAME` command, e.g: `grit apply no_console_log`
