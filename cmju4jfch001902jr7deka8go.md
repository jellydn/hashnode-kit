As 2025 comes to a close, I want to take a moment to reflect on what I learned, how I’ve grown, and where I’m headed next.

This year was one of transformation. I dove deeper into productivity and ergonomics, exploring alternative keyboard layouts. I transitioned through layouts from [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) to [Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium) and spent time with [Enthium](https://github.com/sunaku/enthium/releases/tag/v13) v13, each step expanding my understanding of typing and efficiency. Today, my daily drivers are the [**Silakka 54**](https://squalius-cephalus.github.io/silakka54/) and [**Corne 46**](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboards, both of which are customized with a [Miryoku layout](https://jellydn.github.io/miryoku-silakka54-layout/) that I enjoy working with. What started as curiosity has grown into a genuine passion.

A major shift for me was in how I write code. Over the last six months, I integrated an AI coding assistant ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)) into my workflow. The impact has been profound: approximately **90% of my code is now generated by AI**, with only a small portion requiring manual refinement. This isn’t just about speed: it’s reshaping how I architect solutions, collaborate, and iterate.

With rapid advancement in AI, I expect the pace of change in software development to accelerate even more in 2026. I’m excited by the possibilities this opens: from smarter workflows to entirely new paradigms in creation.

On the content side, I published less on [YouTube](https://www.itman.fyi/) this year than I had hoped. The reason is simple: I’ve been deeply learning, absorbing, experimenting, and improving how I work with AI in real projects. I’m eager to bring this learning back into my content, focusing on **AI-driven development** and tooling in the months ahead.

This year has been foundational, and I feel inspired about what’s coming next.

Thank you to everyone who’s supported me on this journey. Your encouragement has played a big role in where I am today. Wishing you all a remarkable year ahead: may 2026 bring growth, breakthroughs, and joy.
