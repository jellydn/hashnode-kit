## Quick Tip for Better Team Collaboration

Since many teams already have their git commit practices, here’s a simple addition that makes a big difference:

**AI-Generated Code:**

Thore are good examples from my [https://github.com/jellydn/moleculer-typescript-template/](https://github.com/jellydn/moleculer-typescript-template/)

In short, we should keep this as a convention for git.

[AI-Generated | Human Supervised]
```

**Human-Written Code:**

Here is the some example from my [https://github.com/jellydn/tiny-nvim](https://github.com/jellydn/tiny-nvim)

```plaintext
feat: implement user authentication

[Engineer-Written]
```

## Why Do This?

* Reviewers know what they’re looking at instantly
    
* Team learns from both AI and human approaches
    
* Builds trust in AI tools through transparency
    
* Creates clear accountability
    

## Bonus Tip: Clean Up AI Comments

AI tools often generate redundant or overly verbose comments. Clean them up:

**Remove:**

```javascript
// This function calculates the sum of two numbers
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b; // Returns the sum of a and b
}
```

**Keep:**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Only keep comments that explain *why*, not *what*.

## Just Add It

If you’re already updating your commit standards, consider adding this. It takes 5 seconds per commit and saves everyone time during reviews.

Your team will appreciate the clarity.
